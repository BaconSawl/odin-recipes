        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Microwave corn on the cob quickly and easily without crowding your grill or waiting for a whole pot of water to boil. This no-nonsense recipe for corn on the cob lets your microwave and a moist paper towel steam each ear of corn to perfection. I freeze the corn on the cob in plastic bags, and remove a single ear of frozen corn in the cold winter months to have the sweet taste of summer corn throughout the year!</p>
